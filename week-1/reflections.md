## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

For time management, I've never heard of the Pomodoro Technique before. It essentially was breaking your activity/work down into multiple 25 minute segments and getting a feel for how long it takes you do said activity/work. The rest was just focusing and setting a time table up. 

For productivity ideas, I've heard about how meditation can aid you in your mindset, but this was the first time I actually read in-depth about it (i.e. improve focus, less anxiety, more creativity, etc.) I should probably give it a shot since it sounds like a panacea to life. 

Growth mindset should get a special mention. Even though we covered the idea in the prereq, it is an eye opening concept to me. I felt as though, I had a mixed of both growth and fixed mindset, and it helped me identify in which cases I was using which mindset.


What is "Time Boxing"? How can you use it in Phase 0?

You set a time limit, and you see how much you can accomplish within that amount of time. This is oppose to setting a task and working endlessly on it, until it is done. 

Could be a useful technique to employ in solo challenges, set a timer see how much you can get done. Take a break after the timer, and begin the process again.

How do you manage your time currently?

I have a loose time schedule that I follow by. I actually don't think I'm that great at managing my time, and it is something I need to work on.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

It helps me gets done with things that need to be done, but it leaves little for free time. One of my goals this year was reading 50 books and watching 50 movies in the span of the year. Currently at 10 books and 11 movies, I think if I was better at managing my time, I would probably be further along.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so how? 

I'd like to give meditation and timeboxing/pomodoro technique a shot. Meditation was something on my mind for the past year, but I never took the dive in. Now seems like a good time to start. 

If so how? Well start small then go big right? Just start doing it.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

I basically set time aside everyday to work on Dev Bootcamp. Basically want to have 30 hours of free time to work on the challenges assign, and if I get everything done, then I'll go work on other programming related stuff like codecademy.

After reading about managing your time, I'll start timing myself. I know it was already mentioned before that we should start timing how long it takes us to complete a challenge, but now I see the angle in which DBC is coming from.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. What is Shell? What is Bash?

Shell is a program that is a command line interpreter. Bash is the type of Shell program that we are using. There are other Shells out there like PowerShell apparently. I'm assuming different Shell programs just have different naming conventions, and perhaps run on different OSes.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

Copy a file from the desktop to another directory outside of the desktop. Still not sure, if I can do it right or not.

Conceptually, popd and pushd is interesting. And knowing the difference between Cat and Less is tricky as well. Even now, I'm not 100% certain how to describe the difference between Cat and Less. My understanding is that Cat lists the text file in your terminal, while Less almost opens up a "new window" and lists out the content of the text file. 

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Well, I typed in the commands word for word based on the website we were provided and everything came out alright. If I were to do a real world exercise using the command line, I think my results would not go as well.

4.In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

cd would be one of them. Changing directories saves a lot of time as oppose to using the GUI. Grep is useful, it's essentially a search command. 

ls and pwd and both very useful when used together. You should essentially never get lost in the file path and long as you use those two commands. 

I have feeling popd and pushd are both very convenient and time saving tools, but it's not something I have a lot of practice using. 

5.Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd

Prints out the current directory

-ls

List what directories/files you have in the current directory

-mv

"Moves" a file/directory, but it's actually renaming

-cd

Change to a directory in the current directory

-../

Hmm, not sure about this one. Shows that the current name is a directory with the / perhaps. 

-touch

Makes an empty file

-mkdir

Makes an empty directory

-less

Lists out a text file and allows you to "page through it".

-rmdir

Deletes an directory. Has to be empty I think in order for it to work.

-rm

Deletes a file.

-help

Tells you what a command does

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
I'm guessing this would be creating a new Repo and github and then cloning it locally to git. Short answer is that I would copy and paste the instructions on this lecture and call it a day. 

Long answer

To create a repo, you need to set up an account on github first. Once you go to your profile, there's a plus symbol on the top right. Choose "New Repository", it will bring you to a new page where you have to enter a name in for your repo. Then at the bottom of the page, you select "Create Repository". 

Forking repo is essentially copying an existing repository. You go to the repository you want fork and you click on the fork button on the right side of the webpage. Then you need to choose where you want to fork the repo to. 

You want to fork a repo to save time. If you created a new repo, then you have to manually copy the contents of the repo you want by hand. At least that's my assumption. 

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
It was EZ PZ!

I actually didn't have any problems. Which either means I did everything correct, or everything has gone terribly terribly wrong and I haven't realize it yet.

I learned how about both Git and Github and how to create, fork, and clone repos.
