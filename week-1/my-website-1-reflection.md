Reflection 1.6

Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

https://github.com/dbtsui/dbtsui.github.io

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
	To create a repository on GitHub, you first need to create an account. After you create an account, you would go to your profile and search for the “plus” symbol. Click on new repository. Create the repository with any setting that you like. Once that is done, you would take the clone url that Github provides you and open up your terminal. Figure out a destination in which you would want to put your repo, and use the command git clone [url] in order to clone your repo to that location (where url is the url Git Hub gave you). And that’s it.	

Describe what open source means.
Anyone can access your code and modify it as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
In the grand scheme of things, Open Source is a good idea. It allows for anyone to work on all different kinds of software and make any improvements they see fit. I’m sure a lot of the software we see today is open source like Firefox.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
It’s very important. It allows the original creator to be credited with a software. Without it, there would be mass plagiarism all over the net. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I didn’t delete the repo locally this time like I did with Exercise 1.5, so that was nice. I had a hard time pulling the master branch locally again after I merged my branches together on Git Hub. I had to ask chat for help.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Nope, not this time around.
