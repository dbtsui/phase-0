    		<p>
     	 		Kicking off our first week at Dev Bootcamp, we mainly focused on getting to know the in and outs of the command line, git, and git hub. 

      		</p>
      		<p>

      			For those unfamiliar with the command line, imagine if you open up a blank word document (or any text editor for that matter). In this text editor, you can type anything you want, it just won't work 90% of the time if you do that.

      			For instance, pretend you're taking care of a group of kids.If you want them to listen to you, you can can't be all loosey-goosey with your orders, you have to be very specific and very commanding. "SIT DOWN!" *Hits kid in the back of the head*

	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	I used <header> and <section> tags. Really any HTML 5 tag is handy like main, article, section, aside, etc.
	because it makes your html easier to read. Also when you need to apply CSS to your html file, sectioning
	realted groups together makes it a lot easier to modify.

	How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	Did they talk about that in this challenge? I don't remember reading about what order the browser displays
	the elements. If I were to take a guess, the browser reads that it's an HTML file first, then it looks at all
	the tags, probably starts with the header tag first. Then it reads through the rest of the html file and laids 
	out the elements as you had commands in your html file. At least this is what my impresssion is currently, feel free to correct me on this question.

	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	You can basically create preloaded code and access that code with whatever key word you set up. It's actually pretty neat, and I imagine will come in a lot of handy later. Yeah, I'll more than likely create more snippets later, and no I haven't research any existing shortcuts yet.
