Reflection 2.4

What is a wireframe?

Essentially, it is the layout of a webpage. As our reading described, the most apt analogy is an architectural blueprint of a website. 

What are the benefits of wire framing?

A blueprint can be made much faster of a website than actually coding the whole website out. Due to it being black and white, there are less distractions, so it is easy to see what may be wrong. It’s also easy to quickly change and fix if you see something you don’t like. And it is also helpful in organizing how you want to display information on the screen.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

It was alright, it’s more or less like making an outline before you start writing an essay. I see the merit in doing it, and I think it is something you should do before you start coding any website. I do think as I was doing it, I was getting more and more into it. I’m not sure if I ever reach the state of pure exuberance, but it wasn’t bad.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I more or less stuck with my first idea. I changed the placement of where I wanted to put my links and in which order. But the overall layout stuck to my base idea. 

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Do I really have to use wireframe software in order to make a wireframe. I looked deep down into myself and said no, and drew it instead. I probably should use wireframe software to do the exercise and I’m sure it is a powerful tool, but we were only suppose to give ourselves an hour on this challenge. By the time I learn how to use a new software, I felt like my time would already be up.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

Designing my site’s index was interesting. I thought about how I wanted a clean presentation and that why I left our a header and footer bar even though the exercise asked us to put it in. As for tedious…hmm, I suppose getting my pictures to show up when I upload them.
