Reflection 2.3

What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing + Delivery, and Maintenance.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

A site's primary goal usually comes down to two things. Either make money, or spread information around. Since we need to make a website about ourselves, this time the purpose of our website is spread information. 

My website will have a picture of me, my contact information, a link to my blog, an about me section, and projects I've worked on. There will probably be more stuff later when I figure what else I want to add. 

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

I suppose their interest would be in me, since my website is going to be all about me. I'm taking a guess that this website will be for professional contacts, so I would like to address my audience formally. But secretly, I want to make it casual and goofy like my personality.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I would like the intial page to be very clean and very simple. Like when you access google's main page. Then there will be some links on the side or on the bottom that directs you to information that you want to know about me. 

So the action I imagine my vistor would act is that they must "search" to find more information on me. But the "searching" part should be easily accessible.  

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design and user experience should go hand in hand. When you design a website, you're designing it for a certain type of consumer, and trying to figure out how you want consumer to experience your website. 

On a side note for design, it is always about trade-offs. You can't have everything, you always figure what you're trading off when you go down a particular design route.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is desiging something with the user in mind. You want your user to use your product in a certain fashion, and your design will help dictate how they should use it. 

It's valuable because if you have a product, you want it to be easily accesible. If it's too complex, then your user will go to a different competior with an easier to use product. 

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Markdown an image into your webpage. I didn't find the link to be that helpful, and went looking around on google for extra resources. Then I started experimenting, still trying to figure out how to rotate my picture. I have a feeling though that DBC made Markdown vague on purpose.
